# Python Bootcamp Course Repository

Welcome to my Python Bootcamp course repository! This repository contains all the in-class coding projects and exercises I'm completing as part of the Python Bootcamp course. The course covers a wide range of topics, from basic programming concepts to more advanced topics like data analysis and web development.

## Course Overview

This course is designed to help students develop a strong foundation in Python, with an emphasis on practical, hands-on learning. Throughout this course, I will be working on various projects and assignments that will be regularly updated here.

## Repository Structure

- **Day1/**: Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String manipulation and variables
  - `variables.py`: Examples of Python variables.
  - `functions.py`: Basic Python functions.

## Setup and Installation

To use the files in this repository, you will need Python installed on your computer. It is recommended to use Python 3.8 or newer. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Additionally, you may need to install some Python libraries for certain projects, which you can do via pip:
